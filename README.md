# DevOps: The Information Dashboard
## Mentor Rose Wisotzky
## Setup: Follow these steps exactly

1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the directory it creates
3. Make a `database.json` file in the `api` directory


> **Note:** Your `database.json` file is already in the `.gitignore` file for this project, so it will never be added to the repo or pushed to Github.

## Instructions

DevOps is a new product offering a place for developers to store all their data. It's a dashboard application for people to store their developer resources, and share with others.

You will be utilizing all of the skills and concepts that you've learned up to this point in the course.

1. Functions
2. Databases
3. Github
4. Objects
5. CSS/Flexbox
6. Array methods
7. Components
8. Handling user events
9. Implementing CRUD operations
10. Relational data 
11. ERDs Stratagem https://dbdiagram.io/d/5f1861321e6ca02dc1a43ddf
12. WIREFRAME: Login Page https://fqx7h7.axshare.com

To start you off, here's an example of what the resources in your API should look like once it's populated with some data from your application.

### Users

```json
{ "id": 1, "username": "Tasha", "email": "me@me.com", "password": "xxxx" }
```

### Notes

```json
{ "id": 1, "userId": 1, "resourceId": "note": "string" "date": "datetime"  }
```

### Resources

```json
{ "id": 1, "userId": 3, "resource": "How to Create CRUD" "noteId": 1, }
```
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## install `react-bootstrap`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
